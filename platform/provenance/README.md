New releases of the managed CloudUAV components are handled by Lucy Poley at the University of Calgary (l.g.poley@gmail.com). Before each release any tests for the component or service are run to verify integration. After release the services are monitored by a service run by the GeoSensorWeb Lab. Each release will be accompanied by commits and changelog updates on the CloudUAV web site.
